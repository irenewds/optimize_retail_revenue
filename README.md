Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue

In this notebook, we will use SQL to analyze product data for an online sports retail company.

We will work with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic.

We will use techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue!
